###apiPath
Each controller has a variable defined at the beginning called apiPath. This was added so that any new group can easily update the api being used when the project changes hands


Description of each controller:

###ExampleAngular.js
	

###pingraphgui.js
	

###userRoles.js
	
	
### BW***.js files
	The "BW" stands for box and whisker, as these are the old groups files for the box and whisker plots. They largly havn't been modified from the last group.
