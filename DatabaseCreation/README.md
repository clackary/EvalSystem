##Database Readme
###About
	This is a snapshot in time of the local database framework we have been running our tests on. Make sure you get an updated database.  
	The database we were using was not very complete and we had to add a lot of information and add tables to it in order to get things to work.
	Also don't be afraid to ask chi tester for additional tables they might not have included. 
###Recreating the database



***Should the "Semester" table be renamed "Evals_Semester" for the sake of consistancy?*** - Go for it
***Are we using the "Semester" table?*** - Pretty sure
