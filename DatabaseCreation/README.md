This is a snapshot in time of the local database framework we have been running our tests on. Make sure you get an updated database.  
The database we were using was not very complete and we had to add a lot of information and add tables to the database in order to get things to work.



***Should the "Semester" table be renamed "Evals_Semester" for consistancies sake?***
***Are we even really using the "Semester" table?***
