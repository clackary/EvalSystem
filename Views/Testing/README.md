### Testing / Wireframes
This folder contains a few pages that are a work-in-progress.

#### userRoles.html
This is a basic start to the User Roles/Permissions (sometimes we refer to this as the secretary page). Currently, this page displays any User from the database that belongs to a department. This was done to exclude users who did not belong to a department, and eliminates some empty cells in the table.

It contains a few nice features, such as a search box, and each column is sortable. We thought about using this page to see each User's roles, and then be able to change or add a role as needed.

#### SecretaryPermission.html, SelectPermissions.html, PermissionResults.html
This group of pages is meant to be a starting point or wireframe for the secretary to be able to add or edit permissions. In reality, this page may also be used by more than just a secretary. For example, a department chair could also manage their faculty's permissions as well.
