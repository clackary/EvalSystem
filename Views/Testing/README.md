### Testing / Wireframes
This folder contains a few pages that are a work-in-progress.

#### userRoles.html
This is a basic start to the User Roles/Permissions (sometimes we refer to this as the secretary page). Currently, this page displays any User from the database that belongs to a department. This was done to exclude users who did not belong to a department, and eliminates some empty cells in the table.

It contains a few nice features, such as a search box, and each column is sortable. We thought about using this page to see each User's roles, and then be able to change or add a role as needed.
